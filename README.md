## Project Overview

A complete **Security Operations Center (SOC) platform** built from scratch that simulates a real-world enterprise security environment. This project demonstrates my ability to deploy, configure, and automate security operations using industry-standard tools and frameworks.

The platform integrates **SIEM, SOAR, and Case Management** capabilities with **5 custom detection rules** mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, all automated through n8n workflows.

## Purpose & Goals

### Why I Built This

As a IT Administrator transitioning into security operations, I created this project to:

- **Bridge the gap** between theoretical knowledge and hands-on implementation
- **Demonstrate practical skills** in SIEM deployment, detection engineering, and SOAR automation
- **Build a portfolio** that proves I can design and operate enterprise security tools
- **Understand the full attack lifecycle** from detection to response
